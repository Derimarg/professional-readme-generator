## Description
  
As a developer, I want a cool README files generator so I can quickly create a professional README for a new project following the next conditions:

- This application will work with command-line, and accepts user input.
-  After I am prompted for information about my application repository, it will be generated a high-quality professional `README.md`.
- This README file will content the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Prerequisites, Test, Usage, Contributing, Questions and License.
- Entering project title, this will be displayed as the title of the README.
- Entering a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information will be added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
- Choosing a license for my application from a list of options, a badge for that license will be added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
- Entering GitHub username, this will be added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.
- Entering email address, this will be added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.
- clicking on the links in the Table of Contents, I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
